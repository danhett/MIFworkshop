	Powered by reveal.js
	Everything else released under the DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO public license.

	Dan will be leading attendees through a rapid-fire high-energy games design workshop - there are no bad ideas in this session, but hundreds of fun ones. This workshop will cover:
	- How to shake off the fear and start generating ideas bravely
	- Why games thinking and design is a really exciting way of interrogating a subject
	- How to re-assess something you think you know, and create something new and exciting

	The workshop will culminate in an intense ideation session where all attendees will create at least ten (yes, you read that right) playable game prototypes, by remixing existing games or creating new playthings entirely from scratch! Strap in.

					<aside class='notes'>...but I didn't let it go to my head. So, while that was a cool place to work, it was a very nailed-down environment in terms of tech - which is understandable, you need solid stuff if it's going out to millions of users, and I had to really really have my shit together. But really, I'm not a very processey kind of guy - if I never see another JIRA ticket in my life I'll be a happy man.</aside>
